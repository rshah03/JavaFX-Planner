# Planner
A simple planner/todo list app made using JavaFX
<hr />
<b>Brief Description</b><br>
This was my first significant program made using JavaFX. The current functionality enables it to add/remove tasks, though there seem to be several issues with this (working on fixing these). 

I plan on creating and including a .jar file once the debugging is complete, which is the easiest way to run the program with minimal effort on the user-side.
However, for now, somewhat more effortful methods need to be used. <hr /> 
<b>Running the Program</b><br>
<i>Note: You should have the latest version of the Java SDK installed. (Currently: Java 8)</i>
<ol type="1">
  <li>In Command Prompt or Terminal navigate to the directory in which the files are located</li>
  <li>Type: <i>javac itemsTodo.java</i></li>
  <li>In Command Prompt type <i>dir</i> or in Terminal type <i>ls</i>. If you see <u>itemsTodo.class<u> then it was successful in compiling the code. </li>
  <li>Now type <i>java itemsTodo.class</i> and it will run the program, providing you did not make any changes to the code, And if you did, you do not have any errors. </li>
</ol>
